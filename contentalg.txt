This cipher machine functions using adjustable pinwheel positions and an option to select either decryption or encryption. Please input your choice of numbers ranging from 1 to 47 for the pinwheel position. Enter the numbers carefully, as rapid typing might cause the code to respond slowly. To execute the code, simply press "Run". Remember, to decipher a message that you have encrypted, you must use the same pinwheel configuration that was set during the encryption process.
